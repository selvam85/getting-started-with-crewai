      "The bagh nakh,[1] vagh nakh, or vagh nakhya (Marathi: वाघनख / वाघनख्या, Bengali: বাঘনখ, Hindi: बाघ नख, Urdu: باگھ نکھ, lit. tiger claw) is a \"fist-load, claw-like\" dagger, originating from the Indian subcontinent, designed to fit over the knuckles or be concealed under and against the palm. It consists of four or five curved blades affixed to a crossbar or glove and is designed to slash through skin and muscle. It is believed to have been inspired by the armament of big cats, and the term bagh nakh itself means tiger's claw in Hindi.\n",
      "History[edit]\n",
      "There are conflicting reports of the time period in which the bagh nakh first appeared. Poisoned bagh nakh had been used by the Rajput clans for assassinations. The most well-known usage of the weapon was by the first Maratha leader Shivaji who used a bichuwa and bagh nakh to kill the Bijapur general Afzal Khan.[2]\n",
      "After centuries, it is set to return to its homeland(India) from the United Kingdom, where it has been housed in London’s Victoria and Albert Museum.[3]\n",
      "It is a popular weapon among the Nihang Sikhs who wear it in their turbans and often hold one in their left hand while wielding a larger weapon such as a sword in the right hand. It is recommended that Nihang women carry a bagh nakh when going alone to dangerous areas. The Nihangs also have a number of traditional weapons one of them being the Sher-Panja (literally - lion's paw) which is inspired by the bagh nakh. Instead of going in between the gaps in the fingers the Sher panja goes over the wrist and fingers and has claws coming out.\n",
      "While often associated with thieves and assassins,[4] the bagh nakh was also used by wrestlers in a form of fighting called naki ka kusti or \"claw wrestling\" which persisted even under British colonial rule. M. Rousselete, who visited Baroda in 1864, described \"naki-ka-kausti\" as one of the raja's favourite forms of entertainment.[5]\n",
      "The weapons, fitted into a kind of handle, were fastened by thongs to the closed right hand. The men, drunk with bhang or Indian hemp, rushed upon each other and tore like tigers at face and body; forehead-skins would hang like shreds; necks and ribs were laid open, and not infrequently one or both would bleed to death. The ruler's excitement on these occasions often grew to such a pitch that he could scarcely restrain himself from imitating the movements of the duellists.\n",
      "After the Direct Action Day riots, the Bengali Hindu girls, in order to defend themselves, began to wear a kind of sharp weapon resembling bagh nakh while going to school.[6]\n",
      "In the Walt Disney movie, Aladdin and the King of Thieves, the main movie's antagonist, Sa'luk, wields this kind of weapon, made of gold.\n",
      "Variant construction[edit]\n",
      "Several variations of bagh nakh exist, including one in which the single crossbar is replaced by two plates hinged together; with an additional loop and claw for the thumb. Earliest bagh nakh did not utilize loops for the fingers, rather round holes were punched through the central plate. Many bagh nakh also incorporated a spike or blade on one end of the crossbar. This form was known as a bichuwa bagh nakh because the blade was based on that of the bichuwa (scorpion dagger).\n",

India NewsReported by Rounak Kukde, Edited by Samiran MishraUpdated: October 01, 2023 10:12 am ISTThe 'wagh nakh' is expected to be housed at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Museum.Mumbai: Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's legendary wagh nakh, the 'tiger claw' weapon he used to defeat Bijapur sultanate's general Afzal Khan in 1659, is set to return to Maharashtra from London in November.This year marks the 350th anniversary of the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji. The tiger claw weapon will be brought back from London's Victoria and Albert Museum for a three-year exhibition to commemorate the occasion.Maharashtra's Culture Minister, Sudhir Mungantiwar, will arrive in London on Tuesday to sign an agreement with the museum for the return of the weapon. \"In the first phase, we are bringing the wagh nakh. It should be brought here in November, and we are signing an MoU for that. Our effort is to bring it on the day when Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj disemboweled Afzal Khan,\" Mr Mungantiwar had said earlier this month.The wagh nakh is expected to be housed at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Museum in south Mumbai.The Maratha victory at the Battle of Pratapgad in 1659 was a turning point in Chhatrapati Shivaji's campaign to establish the Maratha Empire. Despite being outnumbered, the Marathas defeated the Adilshahi forces led by Afzal Khan, boosting Chhatrapati Shivaji's reputation as a brilliant military strategist.Chhatrapati Shivaji killed Afzal Khan at the foot of Pratapgarh fort in present-day Satara district in Maharashtra. This episode has since become a part of folklore, symbolising Chhatrapati Shivaji's bravery and cunning in defeating a much larger and more powerful enemy.\"When Afzal Khan stabbed Shivaji Maharaj in the back (during the meeting), Shivaji Maharaj used a 'wagh nakh' to kill the cruel, demonic Afzal Khan,\" Mr Mungantiwar said.\"The wagh nakh is a source of inspiration and energy for us. This year also marks the 350th anniversary of Shivaji Maharaj's coronation,\" he added.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comThe authenticity of the 'wagh nakh' is under debate in Maharashtra. History expert Inderjit Sawant has pointed out that the Victoria and Albert Museum website states that Chhatrapati Shivaji did not use the weapon. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray has also questioned the authenticity of the 'wagh nakh'.  India Elections | Read Latest News on Lok Sabha Elections 2024 Live on NDTV.com.

      "\n",
      "Final Answer: The \"Bagh Nakh\" or \"tiger claws\" is a traditional Indian weapon, resembling the claw of a big cat, designed to be worn over the knuckles or concealed within the palm. Historically, it consists of four or five curved blades affixed to a crossbar or a glove, intended to slash through skin and muscle. The weapon is notably linked with Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, a revered figure in Indian history, who famously used it in 1659 to defeat Afzal Khan, a general of the Bijapur Sultanate. This event occurred at the foot of Pratapgarh fort and is a celebrated example of Shivaji Maharaj's military prowess and strategic acumen. The \"wagh nakh\" continues to be a symbol of Shivaji's ingenuity and bravery.\n",

      "The weapon has variations including some with additional loops or spikes, and has been used by different groups such as the Rajputs for assassinations and the Nihang Sikhs as part of their traditional armament.

Within its sturdy walls lived Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, a king as wise as he was brave, beloved by his people and respected by his enemies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shivaji Maharaj was not just a king; he was a vision of hope and freedom for his people during a time when the vast lands of India were under the rule of different Sultanates. The year was 1659, a time of great strife and conflict, but also of immense courage and valor.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most pivotal moments in Shivaji’s life was his encounter with Afzal Khan, a formidable general of the Bijapur Sultanate. Afzal Khan was known for his strength and ruthlessness in battle, and he had been sent to capture Shivaji, to put an end to the rising power of the Marathas. The meeting was to be a diplomatic one, under the guise of forming an alliance, but both leaders knew it was anything but.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Shivaji prepared for this meeting, he knew that facing Afzal Khan in direct combat would be perilous. This is when he decided to rely on his intelligence and the element of surprise. Among his preparations was a special weapon, the \"Bagh Nakh\" or the tiger claws. This weapon was unique, resembling the fearsome claws of a tiger. It was designed to be worn over the knuckles or concealed within the palm, making it both a symbol of stealth and deadly efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fateful day arrived when Shivaji was to meet Afzal Khan at the foothills of Pratapgarh. The air was tense, heavy with the weight of the impending confrontation. As tradition dictated, both leaders were to be unarmed, but Shivaji, with the foresight of a great leader, concealed the Bagh Nakh.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Afzal Khan embraced Shivaji in a customary greeting, he tried to stab the Maratha king with a hidden dagger. But Shivaji, agile and prepared, used the Bagh Nakh with lethal precision. The tiger claws slashed through, and Afzal Khan fell, defeated by the very cunning and bravery he had sought to undermine.\n",
      "\n",
      "This encounter was not just a battle of strength but of wit and strategy. Shivaji’s victory at Pratapgarh became a defining moment in the history of the Marathas. It was a testament to his leadership, his unyielding spirit, and his commitment to the freedom of his people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tale of the tiger claws spread far and wide, inspiring countless generations. The Bagh Nakh, once a mere weapon, became a symbol of Shivaji’s ingenuity and the spirit of the Marathas. It reminded people that in the face of adversity, courage and cleverness are the greatest weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sun set behind the hills of the Deccan, the land whispered the tales of Shivaji Maharaj, the king who wore the tiger claws, not just in his hands, but in his heart, a heart that beat for the freedom and glory of his people.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, children, the story of Shivaji and his tiger claws teaches us that true bravery comes from the mind as much as it does from might. It shows us that with cleverness, courage, and a heart full of valor, even the mightiest of foes can be overcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day forward, every time a child in the land of the Marathas felt fearful or unsure, they remembered Shivaji and his tiger claws, and they knew that they too could be brave, no matter how big the challenge.\n",
      "\n",
